# Effective Lagrangian

This document formalizes the conditional variational scaffold used by the Architrino Assembly Architecture. It bridges the exact, path-history-dependent microdynamics of discrete architrinos with the coarse-grained, effective field theories that govern macroscopic assembly behavior in the Noether Sea, while keeping the Master EOM primary until the variation residual closes.

### Regularized Nonlocal Action and Variation

The Master Equation of motion for architrinos is non-Markovian, driven by the intersection of trajectories with past causal wake surfaces. Consequently, any action-level scaffold for it cannot be a local integral over instantaneous states. It must be a multi-time functional that evaluates the entire path history, and its variation residual must vanish before it is treated as an exact action derivation.

For a finite, isolated set of architrinos parameterized by absolute time $t$ in the Euclidean void, use the $\eta>0$ regularized delayed action (the exact kernel is recovered as $\eta\to0^+$). The admissible interaction sum below excludes trivial self-coincidence: $i\ne j$ terms are retained, and $i=j$ terms are retained only on nontrivial self-hit branches with $t-t_0\ge\tau_{\min}>0$ or with an explicitly declared core regularization.

$$
S_\eta[\{\mathbf{x}_i\}]
=
\int dt \sum_i \frac{1}{2} \mu_{\text{arch}} \|\dot{\mathbf{x}}_i(t)\|^2
- \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}^{\mathrm{adm}}\frac{\kappa \, \sigma_{ij} |q_i q_j|}{c_f}
\int dt \int_{-\infty}^{t} dt_0\,
\frac{\phi_\eta\!\big(g_{ij}(t,t_0)\big)}{r_{ij}(t;t_0)},
$$
$$
g_{ij}(t,t_0)\equiv t-t_0-\frac{r_{ij}(t;t_0)}{c_f},
\qquad
r_{ij}(t;t_0)=\|\mathbf{x}_i(t)-\mathbf{x}_j(t_0)\|,
\qquad
\phi_\eta\equiv\delta_\eta.
$$

where:
*   $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ is the trajectory of architrino $i$.
*   $\mu_{\text{arch}}$ is the universal force/energy bookkeeping constant, not a particle-specific inertial mass.
*   $r_{ij}(t; t_0)$ is the Euclidean separation between reception and emission events.
*   $\delta_\eta$ is a mollified delta function of width $\eta > 0$. It supports Lipschitz control only together with the collision floor, finite-branch, transversality, and integrability assumptions below.
*   $\sigma_{ij} = \mathrm{sign}(q_i q_j)$ enforces attraction for opposite polarities and repulsion for like polarities.

#### Regularization and Admissibility Assumptions

The derivation below is valid under:

- **(EL1)** $\mathbf{x}_i\in C^2([t_a,t_b];\mathbb{R}^3)$ and variations $\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$ are $C^1$ with $\boldsymbol{\xi}_i(t_a)=\boldsymbol{\xi}_i(t_b)=0$.
- **(EL2)** $\phi_\eta\in C_c^1(\mathbb{R})$, $\phi_\eta\ge0$, $\int\phi_\eta(s)\,ds=1$.
- **(EL3)** Collision and trivial-self exclusion on active support: $r_{ij}(t;t_0)\ge r_{\min}>0$ whenever $\phi_\eta(g_{ij}(t,t_0))\neq0$, and for $i=j$ the active support also satisfies $t-t_0\ge\tau_{\min}>0$ unless a separate core regularization supplies the same lower-bound control.
- **(EL4)** Delay-root transversality on active branches: $\partial_{t_0}g_{ij}(t,t_0)\neq0$ when $g_{ij}(t,t_0)=0$.
- **(EL5)** Integrability on the chosen history window (finite window or decay) so differentiation under the time integrals is justified.
- **(EL6)** Delayed branch convention: only $t_0\le t$ contributes (equivalently, the $\Theta(t-t_0)$ branch of the causal selector).

#### Kernel Variation and Branch Reduction

Set $\mathbf{x}_i^\varepsilon=\mathbf{x}_i+\varepsilon\boldsymbol{\xi}_i$ and differentiate at $\varepsilon=0$.

Kinetic term:
$$
\delta S_{\eta,\text{kin}}
=
\sum_i\int_{t_a}^{t_b} \mu_{\text{arch}}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_i\cdot\dot{\boldsymbol{\xi}}_i\,dt
=
-\sum_i\int_{t_a}^{t_b} \mu_{\text{arch}}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_i\cdot\boldsymbol{\xi}_i\,dt.
$$

For the interaction kernel
$$
\mathcal{K}_{ij}(t,t_0)\equiv \frac{\phi_\eta(g_{ij}(t,t_0))}{r_{ij}(t;t_0)},
\qquad
\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}\equiv\frac{\mathbf{x}_i(t)-\mathbf{x}_j(t_0)}{r_{ij}(t;t_0)},
$$
the receiver-coordinate gradient is
$$
\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_i(t)}\mathcal{K}_{ij}
=
-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}
\left[
\frac{\phi_\eta(g_{ij})}{r_{ij}^2}
+
\frac{\phi_\eta'(g_{ij})}{c_f\,r_{ij}}
\right].
$$

This receiver-side gradient is one ingredient in the full first variation, but it is not the whole story: in the double-time action each varied worldline appears both as a receiver coordinate $\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ and as a source coordinate inside transposed kernels. The full branch-resolved variation is carried out in [master-equation](./master-equation.md#exact-nonlocal-lagrangian). On branch charts where the constraint-variation residual vanishes, or is cancelled by an explicitly declared regularized counterterm, the result is the delayed force law
$$
\mu_{\text{arch}}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_i(t)
=
\sum_j \kappa \, \sigma_{ij}|q_i q_j|
\sum_{t_0\in\mathcal{C}_{ij}(t)}
\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}(t;t_0)}
{r_{ij}(t;t_0)^2\,\left|1-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}(t;t_0)\cdot\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)/c_f\right|},
$$
including self-hit branches $j=i$ when the trivial coincidence root is excluded.

The branch collapse used here is an $\eta\to0^+$ simple-root statement, not an identity at arbitrary finite $\eta$. Since
$$
\partial_{t_0}g_{ij}(t,t_0)
=
-\left(1-\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}(t;t_0)\cdot\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)}{c_f}\right),
$$
any branch-local smooth $f$ satisfies
$$
\lim_{\eta\to0^+}\int_{-\infty}^{t} f(t_0)\phi_\eta\!\big(g_{ij}(t,t_0)\big)\,dt_0
=
\sum_{t_0\in\mathcal{C}_{ij}(t)}
\frac{f(t_0)}
\left|1-\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}(t;t_0)\cdot\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)/c_f\right|}
$$
provided the active roots are simple and separated from collision support.

Equivalently, in the finite-$\eta$ branch-selector form one may write
$$
\mu_{\text{arch}}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_i(t)
=
\sum_j \kappa \, \sigma_{ij}|q_i q_j|
\int_{-\infty}^{t}dt_0\,
\frac{\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}(t;t_0)}{r_{ij}(t;t_0)^2}\,
\phi_\eta\!\big(g_{ij}(t,t_0)\big),
$$
with the understanding that the displayed finite-$\eta$ integral is a branch-selector surrogate whose weak limit is the Jacobian-weighted branch law above. The derivative term in $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_i}\mathcal{K}_{ij}$ is absorbed only after the full delayed variation is assembled and the branch reduction is performed.

For an edit or simulation to claim action-derived dynamics, it must therefore report the variation residual
$$
\mathbf{R}_i^{(\eta)}(t)
=
\mu_{\text{arch}}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_i(t)
-
\sum_j\kappa\,\sigma_{ij}|q_iq_j|
\left(
\mathbf{F}_{ij,\mathrm{scale}}^{(\eta)}(t)
+
\mathbf{C}_{ij}^{(\eta)}(t)
\right),
$$
using the scale term and constraint residual defined in [Master Equation](./master-equation.md#exact-nonlocal-lagrangian). The dimensionless window diagnostic is
$$
\epsilon_{\mathrm{var}}^{(\eta)}(W)
=
\frac{
\sum_i\int_W\|\mathbf{R}_i^{(\eta)}(t)\|\,dt
}{
\sum_i\int_W
\left(
\mu_{\text{arch}}\|\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_i(t)\|
+
\|\mathbf{F}_{i,\mathrm{act}}^{(\eta)}(t)\|
\right)dt
+
\varepsilon
}.
$$
The branch law is theorem-grade on $W$ only when this residual tends to zero with the declared branch floors and boundary convention. If it does not, the local effective Lagrangian remains a fitted chart unless an invariant action-level mechanism derives the required counterterm.

The current status is therefore settled at the scaffold level. The pure scalar $1/r$ action is not a universal exact action for the Master EOM; it is valid as an action derivation only on residual-closed charts. The same-support local scalar route and its finite delta-jet extension are ruled out under the restricted assumptions in [master-equation](./master-equation.md#exact-nonlocal-lagrangian): cancelling the derivative residual forces the counterterm to change the accepted inverse-square scale term. The remaining minimal repair is the delayed-interior characteristic-tail kernel stated there. With
$$
u=g+\frac{r}{c_f},
$$
the endpoint-clear candidate is
$$
K_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\eta)}(r,g)
=
\int_{-\infty}^{g}
\frac{\delta_\eta(s)}
{c_f(u-s)^2}
ds,
$$
or the finite-endpoint variant with lower limit $-h_{+}$ after the characteristic gauge has cancelled the endpoint-clearance term. It satisfies
$$
\left(
\partial_r-\frac{1}{c_f}\partial_g
\right)
K_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\eta)}
=
-
\frac{\delta_\eta(g)}{r^2},
$$
so it cancels the derivative-of-constraint residual without changing the accepted inverse-square scale term. Effective Lagrangian reductions should still inherit the Master EOM directly unless they explicitly choose the normalized characteristic-tail kernel and carry its boundary-increment convention on the retained chart.

The normalized characteristic-tail kernel now carries explicit energy, momentum, and angular-momentum wake-history increments in [master-equation](./master-equation.md#exact-nonlocal-lagrangian). An effective Lagrangian reduction may therefore choose that kernel only when it also carries the same boundary-increment convention and reports the corresponding variation and conservation residuals on its branch chart. Without those residuals, the reduced Lagrangian remains a scaffold for the Master EOM rather than an independent proof of the branch force.

### Symmetries and History-Aware Conservation Laws

The regularized action $S_\eta$ is invariant under the fundamental symmetry group of the substrate when the mollifier, history window, and self-branch cutoff preserve those symmetries: the Euclidean group $E(3)$ and absolute time translations $\mathbb{R}_{\text{time}}$; the exact statement is recovered in the $\eta\to0^+$ limit. If the regularization is inserted only at the equation-of-motion level or uses a non-invariant window, the same quantities become diagnostics rather than proved Noether charges.

Because the Lagrangian is nonlocal in time, the corresponding Noether charges are path-history functionals tracking "in-flight" interactions encoded in the causal wakes.

**Energy Functional:**
Invariance under absolute time translation yields a conserved total energy only for the symmetry-preserving action-derived model:
$$
E_{\text{tot}}(t)=K(t)+E_{\text{wake}}(t),
$$
where the action-level nonlocal Noether charge can be written with the weighted causal kernel from [master-equation](./master-equation.md#action-level-wake-energy-functional-at-time-boundary-t). To avoid confusing the receiver-gradient kernel above with the Noether-energy kernel, write
$$
\mathcal{K}_{ij}^{E}(t_1,t_0)
=
\frac{\kappa\,\sigma_{ij}\,|q_iq_j|}{c_f}
\Theta(t_1-t_0)
\frac{\delta\!\big(g_{ij}(t_1,t_0)\big)}
{r_{ij}(t_1,t_0)}.
$$
For the delayed-interior characteristic-tail candidate, the Noether-energy kernel must instead be built from the same normalized action kernel,
$$
\mathcal{K}_{ij,\mathrm{eff}}^{E}(t_1,t_0)
=
\frac{\kappa\,\sigma_{ij}\,|q_iq_j|}{c_f}
\Theta(t_1-t_0)
K_{\mathrm{eff}}^{(\eta)}
\!\left(
r_{ij}(t_1,t_0),
g_{ij}(t_1,t_0)
\right).
$$
The scalar $1/r$ expression remains the diagnostic scaffold only when this replacement has not been declared for the chart.
Then:

$$
E_{\text{wake}}(t)
=
\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j}
\int_{-\infty}^{t} dt_0
\int_{t}^{\infty} dt_1\,
\partial_{t_1}\mathcal{K}_{ij}^{E}(t_1,t_0).
$$

For compatible trajectory reconstruction one may use the work-integral form
$$
U(t)=U_\ast-\int_{t_\ast}^{t}\sum_i \mu_{\text{arch}}\,\mathbf{a}_i(t')\cdot\mathbf{v}_i(t')\,dt',
$$
when it is derived from the same action-level force and boundary convention. Otherwise $U(t)$ is a diagnostic history functional, not an independently proved Noether charge.

The corresponding finite-window energy residual is
$$
\epsilon_E^{(\eta)}(W)
=
\frac{
\left|
\Delta_W\left(K+E_{\text{wake}}^{(\eta)}\right)
-
\int_W\sum_i\mathbf{v}_i\cdot\mathbf{R}_i^{(\eta)}\,dt
-
\int_W\mathcal{B}_E^{(\eta)}\,dt
\right|
}{
\left|\Delta_W K\right|
+
\left|\Delta_W E_{\text{wake}}^{(\eta)}\right|
+
\varepsilon
}.
$$
Here $\mathcal{B}_E^{(\eta)}$ is the declared endpoint or period-cut leakage. For isolated period-matched tests, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{var}}^{(\eta)}\to0$, $\mathcal{B}_E^{(\eta)}\to0$, and $\epsilon_E^{(\eta)}\to0$ are the minimal conservation checks before the effective Hamiltonian is promoted beyond a diagnostic fit.

For a branch chart that explicitly chooses the normalized delayed-interior characteristic-tail kernel, the conservation object is not the generic scalar $1/r$ scaffold above but the pullback
$$
K_{\mu,\mathfrak{B}}+E_{\mathrm{wake,eff},\mathfrak{B}}^{(\eta)},
\qquad
\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{mech},\mathfrak{B}}+\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{wake,eff},\mathfrak{B}}^{(\eta)},
\qquad
\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{mech},\mathfrak{B}}+\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{wake,eff},\mathfrak{B}}^{(\eta)}
$$
defined on the same retained branch rows that enter the force residual. The energy residual above is theorem-level only after this chart declares the action-level $g$, endpoint convention, branch floors, and endpoint or period-cut leakage terms. The work-integral reconstruction $U(t)$ remains a trajectory diagnostic unless it is derived from that same normalized kernel and boundary convention.

**Generalized Momentum:**
Spatial translation invariance guarantees the conservation of total momentum, $\mathbf{P}_{\text{tot}} = \mathbf{P}_{\text{mech}}(t) + \mathbf{P}_{\text{wake}}(t)$, where the mechanical momentum of the architrinos is balanced by the momentum flux propagating within the causal wake surfaces. Boundedness of the history-aware energy is therefore the natural diagnostic against runaway behavior, not a separate postulate.

For an effective reduction to promote a retained chart rather than fit it, it must also report vector residuals for the same branch pullback:
$$
\epsilon_P^{(\eta)}(W)
=
\frac{
\left\|
\Delta_W\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{mech}}+\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{wake,eff}}^{(\eta)}\right)
-
\int_W\sum_i\mathbf{R}_i^{(\eta)}\,dt
-
\int_W\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}_P^{(\eta)}\,dt
\right\|
}{
\left\|\Delta_W\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{mech}}\right\|
+
\left\|\Delta_W\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{wake,eff}}^{(\eta)}\right\|
+
\varepsilon
},
$$
and
$$
\epsilon_J^{(\eta)}(W)
=
\frac{
\left\|
\Delta_W\left(\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{mech}}+\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{wake,eff}}^{(\eta)}\right)
-
\int_W\sum_i\mathbf{x}_i(t)\times\mathbf{R}_i^{(\eta)}\,dt
-
\int_W\boldsymbol{\mathcal{B}}_J^{(\eta)}\,dt
\right\|
}{
\left\|\Delta_W\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{mech}}\right\|
+
\left\|\Delta_W\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{wake,eff}}^{(\eta)}\right\|
+
\varepsilon
}.
$$
Small $\epsilon_E^{(\eta)}$, $\epsilon_P^{(\eta)}$, and $\epsilon_J^{(\eta)}$ are conservation diagnostics when the regularization is inserted at the equation-of-motion level. They become Noether-charge tests only when the action regularization itself preserves time translation, spatial translation, and rotation symmetry on the retained chart.

### Coarse-Graining: The Effective Continuum Lagrangian

To describe the emergent dynamics of the Noether Sea and complex matter assemblies, we transition from discrete trajectories to continuum densities. We define a coarse-grained architrino polarity density $\rho_q(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and current density $\mathbf{j}_q(\mathbf{x}, t)$, smoothed over a scale much larger than the tri-binary radius but smaller than macroscopic gradients. This notation is deliberately distinct from Noether-core density variables such as $\rho_{\text{core}}$ and $n$.

At the level of a branch-collapsed delayed causal action, the exact multi-time interaction double sum suggests the continuum delayed functional

$$
S_{\text{int}}^{\text{cg}} = - \frac{\kappa}{2c_f} \int dt \int d^3x \int d^3x' \,
\frac{\rho_q(\mathbf{x}, t) \rho_q(\mathbf{x}', t - \|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\|/c_f)}
{\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\|\,J_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{x},t;\mathbf{x}',t')}
$$
with delayed source time
$$
t' = t - \frac{\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\|}{c_f},
$$
propagation direction
$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')=
\frac{\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'}{\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'\|},
$$
coarse transport velocity
$$
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}',t')
=
\frac{\mathbf{j}_q(\mathbf{x}',t')}{\rho_q(\mathbf{x}',t')}
\qquad (\rho_q\neq 0),
$$
and effective Jacobian
$$
J_{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbf{x},t;\mathbf{x}',t')
=
\left|1-\frac{\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}',t')\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}')}{c_f}\right|.
$$
This is the continuum inheritance of the discrete delayed causal $1/r$ action kernel together with the same Jacobian branch weight that appears in the master equation. Source emission remains isotropic at the microscopic level, but the received coarse flux is compressed or dilated by the delayed transport geometry. Differentiating this delayed action with respect to receiver coordinates produces the corresponding Jacobian-weighted inverse-square force density plus velocity-dependent correction terms. In the quasi-static limit $\|\mathbf{u}\|/c_f\to0$, one recovers $J_{\mathrm{eff}}\to 1$ and the leading force law reduces to the familiar inverse-square form.

The continuum variables are admitted only through balance laws inherited from resolved histories. A coarse polarity density and current must satisfy
$$
\partial_t\rho_q+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}_q
=
R_{\rho}^{\mathrm{cg}},
$$
and the first two kinetic moments must close through a declared momentum-current tensor and energy-flux vector,
$$
\partial_t(\rho_q u^i)
+\partial_j\Pi_q^{ij}
=
f_q^i+R_{P,q}^i,
$$
$$
\partial_t e_q
+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}_{e,q}
=
\mathbf{f}_q\cdot\mathbf{u}
+R_{E,q}.
$$
Here $\Pi_q^{ij}$ and $\mathbf{J}_{e,q}$ are coarse-history summaries of the retained causal-wake record, not new substrate fields. The effective action is a promoted continuum chart only when $R_{\rho}^{\mathrm{cg}}$, $R_{P,q}^i$, and $R_{E,q}$ are small under history, spatial, and regulator refinement. Otherwise the chart has only reproduced low-order moments while leaving unresolved memory in the omitted kinetic hierarchy.

For near-equilibrium reductions, a constitutive response may be written schematically as
$$
\Pi_q^{ij}
=
\Pi_{\mathrm{rev}}^{ij}
-
2\eta_{\mathrm{cg}}
\left(
E^{ij}-\frac{1}{3}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})h^{ij}
\right)
-
\zeta_{\mathrm{cg}}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})h^{ij}
+\Pi_{\mathrm{mem}}^{ij},
$$
where $E^{ij}=\frac{1}{2}(\partial^iu^j+\partial^ju^i)$. This is a comparison form borrowed from continuum mechanics and kinetic theory. In $\mathbb{A}\mathbb{A}\mathbb{A}$ it becomes native only after $\eta_{\mathrm{cg}}$, $\zeta_{\mathrm{cg}}$, and $\Pi_{\mathrm{mem}}^{ij}$ are derived from the same delayed branch record that supplies the force law. The corresponding dissipation residual is
$$
\mathcal R_{\mathrm{diss}}(W)
=
\frac{
\left|
\Delta_W K_{\mathrm{cg}}
+\int_W
2\eta_{\mathrm{cg}}E_{ij}E^{ij}
+\zeta_{\mathrm{cg}}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})^2\,dt\,dV
+\Delta_W E_{\mathrm{wake}}
\right|
}{
|\Delta_W K_{\mathrm{cg}}|
+\int_W
\left(
2\eta_{\mathrm{cg}}E_{ij}E^{ij}
+\zeta_{\mathrm{cg}}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})^2
\right)dt\,dV
+|\Delta_W E_{\mathrm{wake}}|
+\varepsilon
}.
$$
This residual prevents ordinary viscous loss language from replacing the exact wake-history energy ledger. A nonzero positive quadratic term is allowed as a coarse channel for coherent-to-incoherent transfer, but the transferred content must appear in the retained wake, heat, or medium-response record.

By defining an effective scalar potential $\Phi_{\text{wake}}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ and a vector transport potential $\mathbf{A}_{\text{wake}}(\mathbf{x}, t)$ that track the integrated causal wakes of the continuous medium, the system maps locally onto an effective field theory. These potentials are bookkeeping fields for delayed transport, not additional ontological primitives. The resulting local Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}}$ therefore belongs to a further closure step beyond the exact delayed causal action.

### Effective Hamiltonian Domain Gate

A local Hamiltonian or local Lagrangian description is admissible only after the path-history law has been reduced to a finite set of coarse variables that preserve the relevant state-counting measure over the comparison window. Let $\mathcal{Q}$ be the coarse-graining from exact histories $\Gamma(t)$ to effective coordinates $z=(\rho_q,\mathbf{j}_q,\ldots)$, and let $\mathcal{P}_{\Delta t}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ be the induced effective flow. The local canonical approximation must supply a measure $\mu_{\mathcal{Q}}$ such that
$$
(\mathcal{P}_{\Delta t}^{\mathrm{eff}})_*\mu_{\mathcal{Q}}
=
\mu_{\mathcal{Q}}
+O(\epsilon_{\mathcal{Q}})
$$
on the retained regime. This measure condition is necessary but not sufficient for canonical mechanics. The same handoff must also control a bracket or symplectic residual, for example
$$
\left\|
(\mathcal{P}_{\Delta t}^{\mathrm{eff}})^*\omega_{\mathcal{Q}}
-
\omega_{\mathcal{Q}}
\right\|
\le
\epsilon_{\omega},
$$
for the retained two-form $\omega_{\mathcal{Q}}$, or an equivalent Poisson-bracket residual on the admitted observables. If $\epsilon_{\mathcal{Q}}$ or $\epsilon_{\omega}$ is not controlled, the local Hamiltonian is only a fitting chart, not a derived mechanics.

This gate keeps the exact and effective levels separate. The Master Equation owns the delayed causal dynamics; the effective Hamiltonian owns only those regimes where internal wake memory, branch changes, and unresolved Noether-Sea exchange have been compressed without losing the observer-level invariants being compared.

The same domain restriction applies before translating an effective Hamiltonian chart into quantum operators. The admissible observable set in [Quantum Operator Mapping](../theory-bridges/quantum-operator-mapping.md#admissible-quantization-domain-guardrail) must be derived from this retained coarse-graining and record window, not chosen afterward as a free quantization convention.

### Topological Constraints and Assembly Stability

The delayed action, after branch reduction to causal-locus and root-ledger data, constrains the allowed topological configurations of the architrino medium. Stable assemblies, such as nested maximal-curvature candidates inside tri-binaries, should therefore be treated as theorem targets for localized, phase-locked causal-locus classes rather than as already-proved vortices or knots of a continuum field.

The stability of these assemblies must be checked by the nonlinear self-hit feedback embedded in the interaction functional. When internal circulation velocities exceed $c_f$, the non-Markovian repulsion supplies a candidate branch-trapping mechanism; it becomes a robust geometric attractor only after a branch chart, Lyapunov or Floquet diagnostic, and history-aware energy bound are supplied. Likewise, mass-gap language is a closure target tied to discrete admissible branch classes, not an automatic consequence of writing the effective action.

### Closure Interface: Action-to-Envelope Reduction

This chapter supplies the variational bridge used by the quantum closure chain.

From the regularized nonlocal action, derive a continuum effective action in terms of coarse fields $(\rho_q,\mathbf{j}_q)$, then test a phase-amplitude closure ansatz for the retained nonnegative envelope channel:
$$
\rho_{\mathrm{env}}=|\psi|^2,\qquad
\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{env}}=\frac{\hbar_{\mathrm{eff}}}{m_{\mathrm{eff}}}\Im(\psi^*\nabla\psi).
$$
Here $m_{\mathrm{eff}}$ is the retained envelope mass parameter of the benchmark chart, not a primitive architrino mass. The projection from the signed polarity/current data $(\rho_q,\mathbf{j}_q)$ to the nonnegative envelope channel must be declared before $\rho_{\mathrm{env}}$ is interpreted as $|\psi|^2$.

The handoff must report the continuity residual
$$
R_{\mathrm{cg}}=\partial_t\rho_{\mathrm{env}}+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{env}},
\qquad
\epsilon_{\mathrm{cg}}=
\frac{\|R_{\mathrm{cg}}\|}
{\|\partial_t\rho_{\mathrm{env}}\|+\|\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{env}}\|+\varepsilon},
$$
and keep the memory current
$$
\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{mem}}
=
\mathbf{j}_q-\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{env}}
$$
as an explicit residual rather than absorbing it into fitted constants. Equivalently, with $\Delta\rho=\rho_q-\rho_{\mathrm{env}}$,
$$
\partial_t\rho_q+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}_q
=
R_{\mathrm{cg}}
+
\partial_t\Delta\rho
+
\nabla\cdot\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{mem}}.
$$
Thus a small $R_{\mathrm{cg}}$ by itself does not prove envelope closure; the projection mismatch and memory-current divergence must be controlled as well.

For the non-relativistic, fixed-particle-number benchmark, the same envelope must also admit a phase chart
$$
\psi=\sqrt{\rho_{\mathrm{env}}}\,e^{iS_{\mathrm{env}}/\hbar_{\mathrm{eff}}},
\qquad
\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{env}}=\frac{\rho_{\mathrm{env}}}{m_{\mathrm{eff}}}\nabla S_{\mathrm{env}}.
$$
Define
$$
K_{\mathrm{env}}=\frac{\|\nabla S_{\mathrm{env}}\|^2}{2m_{\mathrm{eff}}},
\qquad
Q_{\mathrm{env}}
=
-\frac{\hbar_{\mathrm{eff}}^2}{2m_{\mathrm{eff}}}
\frac{\nabla^2\sqrt{\rho_{\mathrm{env}}}}{\sqrt{\rho_{\mathrm{env}}}},
$$
and test the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi residual
$$
R_{\mathrm{HJ}}
=
\partial_t S_{\mathrm{env}}
+K_{\mathrm{env}}
+V_{\mathrm{eff}}
+Q_{\mathrm{env}}.
$$
The effective Schrödinger/Madelung chart is licensed on a retained window only when
$$
\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{env}}
=
\max\!\left(
\epsilon_{\mathrm{cg}},
\frac{\|R_{\mathrm{HJ}}\|}
{\|\partial_t S_{\mathrm{env}}\|+\|K_{\mathrm{env}}\|+\|V_{\mathrm{eff}}\|+\|Q_{\mathrm{env}}\|+\varepsilon},
\frac{\|\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{mem}}\|}{\|\mathbf{j}_q\|+\varepsilon}
\right)
\le\epsilon_{\mathrm{env}}.
$$
This is a comparison residual, not a new ontology. If it fails, the wavefunction and Hamiltonian remain useful fitting charts for that window rather than promoted quantum closure.

Closure requirement for this interface:
- the Euler-Lagrange equations of the coarse action reproduce the effective envelope equation used in [pilot-wave-character](../theory-bridges/pilot-wave-character.md),
- the phase-amplitude chart reports $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{env}}$ rather than assuming the Schrödinger limit,
- memory contributions $\mathbf{j}_{\mathrm{mem}}$ remain explicit as controlled correction terms rather than hidden parameter absorbs.
