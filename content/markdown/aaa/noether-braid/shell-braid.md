# Shell Braid

This chapter defines the one-band support family in the [Noether Braid](noether-braid.md) sequence. A shell braid adds controlled radial support to a [neutral braid](neutral-braid.md) without yet asserting the three ordered support bands of a [nested shell braid](nested-shell-braid.md).

A shell braid is the first step from balanced inventory toward spatial organization. The word `shell` says that the six paths stay within a controlled support band around a branch center. It does not say that the branch has already retained, that exact binary pairs exist, or that nested support bands have appeared.

A **shell braid** over a branch interval $J$ is a neutral braid whose six trajectories remain in a controlled radial band around a declared branch-center curve $\mathbf C:J\to\mathbb{R}^3$. For band limits $R_- < R_+$ and a representative shell scale $R_*$ satisfying $R_- \leq R_* \leq R_+$, the shell condition is

$$
R_-\leq
\left\| \mathbf X_i(T)-\mathbf C(T)\right\|
\leq R_+,
\qquad
i=1,\ldots,6,
\qquad
T\in J
$$

A narrow shell branch has small relative spread,

$$
\frac{R_+-R_-}{R_*}\leq\varepsilon_{\mathrm{shell}}
$$

while a broader shell branch keeps only the hollow-band condition. This is still not the nested shell braid. It is a one-band neutral braid whose support is spatially organized strongly enough to make a candidate exclusion envelope, shielding pattern, and Noether sea coupling channel meaningful for later certificate rows.

Near-antipodality is an optional shell braid constraint, not a definition of the neutral braid. A shell branch may carry an approximate fixed-point-free polarity-reversing involution $\iota$ with $\iota^2=\mathrm{id}$ and $\sigma_{\iota(i)}=-\sigma_i$, giving three opposite-polarity pairs. Relative to the declared branch-center curve $\mathbf C(T)$, define the near-antipodality defect

$$
\delta_{\mathrm{anti},i}(T)
=
\frac{
\left\| \mathbf X_i(T)+\mathbf X_{\iota(i)}(T)-2\mathbf C(T)\right\|
}{R_*}
$$

Exact antipodality, $\delta_{\mathrm{anti},i}=0$, is an ideal symmetry chart. It should not be expected in ordinary conditions: an external potential can disturb one member of the matching first, and the delayed response takes time to circulate through the full six-body causal ledger. The physical shell claim is therefore near-antipodality plus recovery,

$$
\sup_{T\in J}\delta_{\mathrm{anti},i}(T)
\leq
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{anti}},
\qquad
\delta_{\mathrm{anti},i}(T+T_{\mathrm{rec}})
\leq
\theta_{\mathrm{rec}}\,\delta_{\mathrm{anti},i}(T)+\varepsilon_{\mathrm{drive}}
\qquad
T,T+T_{\mathrm{rec}}\in J
$$

for recovery time $T_{\mathrm{rec}}$, dimensionless recovery contraction factor $0\leq\theta_{\mathrm{rec}}<1$, and driving residue $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{drive}}$. Near-antipodality is useful because it captures the shell branch's tendency to restore opposite-side balance without pretending that the two matched architrinos remain in lockstep under perturbation.
