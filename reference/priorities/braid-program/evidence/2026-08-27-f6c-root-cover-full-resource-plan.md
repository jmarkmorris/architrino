# F6c Full Root-Cover Resource Return

Status: `RESOURCE-RETURN`; full 160-cell attempt not launched, 2026-08-27. This planning disposition awaits the separate independent audit of the completed one-cell pilot and review of this document. The [governing root-cover predeclaration](2026-08-27-f6c-continuous-reception-root-cover-predeclaration.md) fixes an unchanged, inclusive 1,800-second full-run ceiling and requires return without launch when its prescribed pilot-based projection does not fit. No larger budget, parallel worker count, replacement scientific subject or automatic retry is selected here.

Plainly: the first cell completed successfully, but its measured cost does not pass the existing rule for starting the full calculation. This is a resource return, not a rejection of the F6c geometry.

## Bound Pilot And Unchanged Contract

The completed attempt is `pilot-cell-0-v1` under `.local-data/braid-analysis/f6c-continuous-reception-root-cover-20260827/`. The following original files, not copied or regenerated outputs, identify its planning baseline.

Plainly: these hashes attach the estimate to one actual calculation and its separately written checker. A different implementation, runtime or input would need its own reviewed evidence; this document does not substitute one.

The machine plan and pilot receipt retain the complete captured source and runtime closure, including all 158 runtime bindings, the shared-venv invocation path separately from its resolved interpreter, the original export, and the accepted reconstruction and uniform-guard receipts. Their byte identities remain unchanged. The pilot watcher and entry remain frozen at `a0ce2d3eeeb248b43cda5bb8ebcca4b0c6544af8093d28bae1c233c53236d705` and `6b9c1b6489214039e8de485eb5bfdbbc1e896c0433bb8cdebb12acf629fcf00a`, respectively. This document is not a machine launch plan and authorizes no new process.

Plainly: the existing evidence includes which programs actually ran. Recording the full-run resource return does not change those programs or start another calculation.

## Measured One-Cell Baseline

The coordinator observed fresh successful launcher completion with exit code zero, `accepted:true`, the matching pilot-admission hash above and the following final measurements. Its separate independent audit remains pending at this document's drafting. Stage measurements and file bindings are also retained in the admission receipt; final whole-attempt time and the final sample count come from the fresh launcher completion, not from the receipt's earlier pre-publication snapshot.

| Quantity | Measured value and scope |
| --- | --- |
| Whole-attempt elapsed time | `22.353614791` seconds, including source capture, both stages, publication and cleanup |
| Consumer reported elapsed time | `17.39154341700487` seconds; not the whole attempt |
| Independent comparison reported elapsed time | `3.9261386250145733` seconds; not the whole attempt |
| Maximum sampled aggregate resident memory | `376569856` bytes across the launcher's declared conservative owned-process scope, excluding bounded process-table probes |
| Final memory observation count and maximum gap | `99` samples; `0.279311208000001` seconds maximum observed gap |
| Named subject and comparison output bytes | `263924` bytes: rows `136659`, pieces `44394`, manifest `41385`, comparison `41486`; excludes operational logs, the admission receipt and other shared metadata |
| Completed scientific census | One closed reception cell `[0,0.001]`; 64 pair-cell rows, 56 ordinary nonself rows, eight self exclusions, 112 distinct nonself face checks and 112 compact geometry-piece records |
| Recorded geometry-piece visits | `89208`; counts returned root-geometry coverage only, not all internal face traversals or a runtime proxy |

Plainly: this is measured work on one actual cell. The memory number is the largest sampled total for the owned processes, not an allocation limit or an unobserved continuous peak. The file-size total counts the four named scientific files only.

The immutable admission receipt records `98` samples and `22.230326916000003` seconds in its explicitly pre-publication fields. Those values are not contradictory replacements for the final `99` samples and `22.353614791` seconds observed at fresh completion. The receipt's per-stage `process.elapsedWallSeconds` values are elapsed time from the common outer start through that stage's closure, not each stage's standalone duration. The two stage durations above use their nested completion fields instead.

Plainly: the stored receipt was assembled before the launcher finished its final write and exit checks. The full-run estimate uses the later whole-attempt measurement, so that final work is not omitted.

## Required Projection And Decision

The predeclaration requires the following planning extrapolation from the whole-attempt pilot measurement:

$$
160\times 22.353614791\ \mathrm{s}
=3576.57836656\ \mathrm{s}
>1800\ \mathrm{s}.
$$

Plainly: repeating the measured first-cell cost 160 times gives about 59.6 minutes, above the fixed 30-minute allowance. The decimal multiplication is exact for the recorded time token, but it is not a proof of the full run's actual cost.

Later cells include different evolved-piece coverage, while startup, runtime capture and final publication are partly shared. The projection is therefore neither an upper bound nor a lower bound; it does not prove that an actual full run must exceed 1,800 seconds. It does establish that the predeclared launch test fails on this measured baseline. No full evaluation is launched to find out whether an optimistic cost assumption happens to succeed.

Plainly: the existing launch rule uses this estimate as its decision test. That test can fail without making a claim about every possible implementation or about the geometry.

For size planning only, multiplying the first-cell row-stream and piece-stream sizes by 160 gives `21865440` and `7103040` bytes, respectively. These are estimates, not bounds: later token widths and records can differ. They neither replace the unchanged 64 MiB per-file stopping limit nor cure the failed wall-time admission. No aggregate full-output or peak-memory guarantee is inferred from the pilot.

Plainly: the raw streams look small enough to discuss, but their estimated size does not supply the missing time budget. The existing file and memory protections remain necessary.

## Preserved Scope, Limits And Dispositions

The unexecuted full target remains the same 161 exact future knots forming 160 closed reception cells, with the accepted 81 frame knots as a subset. Its census remains 10,240 rows: 8,960 ordinary nonself rows and 1,280 self exclusions, together with 17,920 distinct nonself face checks and 17,920 compact receiver/transmitter geometry-piece records. A future admitted full attempt would recompute all 160 cells and then run the unchanged independent comparison; it would not resume the pilot or count the pilot's first cell as already completed work in that attempt. At this resource return, all 10,240 rows of the separate full attempt are `not-run`.

Plainly: the successful pilot retains its one-cell scope. The full calculation is a separate complete attempt, and none of its unperformed work is marked passed.

The following existing operating limits are preserved, not newly authorized: 1,800 seconds inclusive of capture through final publication and closed owned processes; one serial evaluation worker followed by one independent comparison, zero EOM workers and no overlapping F5 response pilot; flushed 15-second heartbeats; conservative owned-process resident-memory monitoring no more than one second apart with the existing 2 GiB stop; host admission of at least 40 percent reported free memory and 64 GiB available disk, with a stop below 20 percent or 16 GiB during work; two-second memory-query timeout; 64 MiB per named raw/comparison file and 16 MiB combined operational logs/rejection diagnostics. Monitoring loss, malformed observations, source drift, failed comparison, unresolved rows, publication failure or incomplete cleanup remain failures. Fresh write-once outputs, no automatic retry and no overwrite/resume remain mandatory under the [one-cell resource plan](2026-08-27-f6c-root-cover-pilot-resource-plan.md) and governing predeclaration.

Plainly: nothing in this return relaxes the time, machine-safety or evidence rules. Since the launch test already fails, no full-run output directory, worker or numerical job is created here.

Both frozen Python entrypoints independently enforce `LIMIT = 1800` and reject a larger supplied remaining budget. Merely placing a longer-lived outer watcher around them would not change their accepted operating domain. This observation identifies an existing contract boundary; it does not authorize editing those sources or selecting a replacement ceiling.

Plainly: a larger outer timer would not make the current programs accept a larger allowance. Changing the budget would be a separate protocol decision, not a hidden launch setting.

## Remaining Choices And Claim Boundary

The next administrative step is independent acceptance or correction of the actual pilot audit and this resource-return calculation. After that, only separate future choices are identified here: independently reviewed subject-only performance investigation or revision that preserves the frozen mathematical library and independent comparison, or an explicitly authorized budget/protocol revision. No optimization, new instrument, wider budget value, additional worker, source successor or numerical rerun is selected or approved in this document. Any performance improvement would require a new measured baseline; an unmeasured speedup hypothesis cannot replace the failed projection.

Plainly: the current result tells us why the full run cannot start under its existing rules. A later task may improve the implementation or change the allowed protocol, but this document does neither.

The pilot's passing comparison is conditional root coverage for the proved anchored-past/fixed-future reconstructed family inside the original enclosures. It is not historical EOM trajectory identity, original analytic-prehistory membership, an exact Master Equation solution, acceleration or residual measurement, `M05/M06` availability, three-rung refinement, H3 evidence, score authorization, ordinary evolution, equilibrium, binding, retention, return, stability or physical realization. The library's five authority flags remain false, and this resource return grants no execution authorization. No mathematical negative is inferred from not launching the full run.

Plainly: the first cell checks the stated reconstructed-history family. The remaining full coverage and later acceleration measurements are still unfinished; the resource return adds no physical verdict.

The baseline is invalidated if independent audit finds a mismatched receipt/completion hash, different inclusive elapsed token, omitted owned process, invalid sampled-resource scope, wrong output census or failed mathematical comparison. The resource-return arithmetic is invalidated by an incorrect multiplication or a misstatement of the governing ceiling. A separately authorized changed protocol would be a new decision, not a retroactive passing result for this unchanged plan.

Plainly: these are checkable ways to overturn the report. Until such a correction or separately approved next task exists, the full attempt remains not launched.

Closure goal: independently close the one-cell audit and this unchanged-budget resource return; leave all full-run rows not-run and all frozen scientific sources untouched.
